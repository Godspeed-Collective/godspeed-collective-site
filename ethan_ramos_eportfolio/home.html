      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hey there! I'm Ethan D. Ramos, the driving force behind <strong>Godspeed Collective</strong> and its sub-brands. My journey has been anything but ordinary, shaped by a blend of passions, experiences, and a relentless drive to innovate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ðŸš— Passionate About Cars & Tech</strong><br />
        From a young age, I was immersed in the world of computers and photography, thanks to my upbringing. This early exposure sparked a deep interest in technology and digital media. In high school, I discovered my love for cars, diving into the mechanics and culture that surround them. This passion has since evolved into a multifaceted interest that fuels both my personal and professional endeavors.

      <p>
        <strong>ðŸŽ® Gamer, Creator, and Connector</strong><br />
        I'm an extrovert at heart, thriving in social settings and building connections. Whether it's gaming, photography, or videography, I find joy in creating content that resonates with others. My skills extend to computer systems and car mechanics, allowing me to approach challenges from a technical perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ðŸ’¼ From IT Help Desk to Entrepreneur</strong><br />
        Professionally, I honed my problem-solving abilities working in IT support, where I assisted users with technical issues and streamlined processes. This experience laid the foundation for my entrepreneurial journey, leading to the establishment of Godspeed Collectiveâ€”a platform that embodies my vision and passions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ðŸŒ± Building the Future</strong><br />
